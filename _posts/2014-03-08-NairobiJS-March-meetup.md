JavaScript enthusiasts in Nairobi had their monthly meetup last saturday at the iHub. The event was convened by [@techytimo](https://twitter.com/tecytimo) and we are greatful for his efforts. We also are thankful for [@firebase](https://twitter.com/firebase) for sponsoring the event and [@iHub](https://twitter.com/iHub) for the space and wifi.

We had a couple of presentations lined up with the main theme being how to build your front end with angular. We were started off by [@connorleech](https://twitter.com/cleechtech) who took the group through building a simple chat application with angular framework and the awesome [@firebase](https://twitter.com/firebase) realtime application framework. This was a live coding session where attendees wrote code as they followed through and listened to him explain concepts and code on the big screen. It was a great environment to learn as those who had their code working helped others who had bugs. Once in a while [@connorleech](https://twitter.com/cleechtech) had to pause for attendees to catch up. All in all it was a really good learning experience.

Next, we had [@charleskagiri](https://twitter.com/charleskagiri), give a talk on how he used AngularJS to build his single page application - a site for football fans to check info about their favorite teams performances. His talk was very enjoyable and informative and was made more interesting by the attendees periodically chiming in with questions and comments. He mainly dwelt on the great power of AngularJS and how it helps developers to abstract code, prototype faster and be more productive. The challenges he mentioned are the nature of the JavaScript language (especially that he is from the ASP.NET world) and the varied implementation of the DOM and browsers.

Next up was pizza, oh yes pizza! After so much learning it was necessary to refresh.

The afternoon session was a bit more relaxed. Attendees chose to continue coding individually or in groups and seek help with bugs. They would stay on or leave at their own pleasure.
