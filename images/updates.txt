but unless your business is started out of necessity, money should be a means to an end, not an end in itself.

If you are an opportunity-driven startup, you better have a better reason for existing than to “make money.”

Most companies just start with what they do, and pretty much end there. “You bake bread (make cars, design dresses, etc.)… Ok, so what?”

As Sinek repeats over and over, “People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.”
